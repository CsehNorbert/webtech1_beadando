                <h1>Colours</h1>
                <p1>Colour is like a thing that stuff around us have. Mostly. Sometimes you look at something ang go like "woah, that stuff has no colour" but in reality, that stuff is just white. Yeah, white is a colour. I know it's rad. But glass has no colours. Ecvept when it has. Than we call it coloured glass, but that doesn't necesary mean it's red, because colou-RED glass could be blue for example</p1>
